- 👋 Namaste, I’m @saswatkpati, a 4th year Integrated MSc student at NISER, Bhubaneswar, majoring in Chemistry with a minor in Computer Sciences. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Computational Chemistry, Molecular Dynamics simulations and learning how molecules behave to perform magical chemical reactions so as to make sense for muggles.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ORCA, Python packages for Chemistry, Gaussian, Turbomole and dad jokes :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Docking, MD Simulation and applied ML for Chemistry Projects etc.
- 📫 How to reach me: mail- saswat.kpati@niser.ac.in
